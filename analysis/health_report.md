# Codebase Health Report

## Linting (`make lint`)
- **Status:** Failed
- **Key issues:** Dozens of Ruff findings including long lines, unused imports, improper import ordering, and duplicate definitions (e.g., long lines in `astroengine/electional/solver.py`, unused imports and formatting problems across multiple horary modules, and duplicate definitions in vedic modules).【8907e5†L1-L68】

## Type Checking (`mypy .`)
- **Status:** Failed
- **Key issues:** `mypy` is unable to parse `mypy.ini` due to a syntax error on line 17, preventing the type checker from running. Attempting to run anyway surfaces thousands of annotation and typing violations across the project; resolving the configuration error is a prerequisite to meaningful results.【ac167b†L1-L3】【1899a8†L1-L120】

## Test Suite (`pytest -q`)
- **Status:** Skipped
- **Key issues:** With third-party plugins disabled, the tests abort immediately because `tests/conftest.py` skips the entire run when `pyswisseph` is not installed. Installing `pyswisseph` (or providing the expected stub) is required to execute the pytest suite.【c1bc86†L1-L61】

## Diagnostics (`make doctor`)
- **Status:** Failed (strict mode)
- **Summary:** The diagnostics tool reports overall status `worst=WARN` and exits non-zero under `--strict`. Warnings highlight the missing Swiss ephemeris library/data (`swisseph`/`pyswisseph`), unstamped Alembic migrations, and unsuccessful Swiss-specific probes, although other dependencies load successfully.【6f1f3d†L1-L32】

## Recommendations
1. **Fix `mypy.ini` syntax** so the configuration loads, then address the outstanding typing errors iteratively.
2. **Install `pyswisseph` and the Swiss ephemeris dataset** to allow pytest and diagnostics to complete without skipping critical functionality.
3. **Tackle Ruff lint failures** beginning with structural issues (duplicate definitions, import placement) before formatting-only cleanups to reduce cascade effects.
4. **Run Alembic migrations** or stamp the database to align it with the latest schema revision once dependencies are resolved.
