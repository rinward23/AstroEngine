This thin wrapper exists so the PyInstaller bundle can resolve the
desktop experience defined in :mod:`app.desktop.launch_desktop`.  It
does not perform any orchestration itselfâ€”the heavy lifting lives in
the shared desktop module which keeps the FastAPI service, embedded
Streamlit portal, pywebview shell, and tray automation consistent with
the rest of the codebase.
