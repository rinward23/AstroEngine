# Provider Parity Fixtures

This directory stores the representative charts exercised by `tests/test_provider_parity.py`.
The payloads align with the tolerances documented in `docs/module/providers_and_frames.md`
so QA automation can keep Swiss Ephemeris and Skyfield outputs within the supported bands.
