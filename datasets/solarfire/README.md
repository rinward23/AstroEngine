# Solar Fire Export Archive Stub

This directory stores native Solar Fire export files (`*.sf`, `*.txt`) referenced by AstroEngine interoperability specs. Populate
it with signed copies of the datasets cited in `docs/module/interop.md` and record SHA256 checksums in
`docs/governance/data_revision_policy.md` before running validation. Do not commit proprietary files to Git; use this folder as a
mount point during development.
