  notes: >
    Single-file ruleset implementing Physical / Psychological / Spiritual domains,
    dynamic natal sensitivities, hierarchical gating, continuous orb→severity curve,
    diversity-weighted confidence, adjusted cross-domain bleed, and gentle flagging.
    Jungian overlay is ON by default; Tarot/Numerology/Jyotish are available but OFF.
