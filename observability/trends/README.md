# Nightly Benchmark Trends

This directory stores time-series metrics generated by
`scripts/perf/nightly_smoke.py`. Each entry captures the execution time and
result highlights for the deterministic electional search and forecast stack
runs used by the nightly smoke workflow.

The `nightly-metrics.json` file is produced automatically during CI to track
performance across runs. It is intentionally ignored from version control so
local experiments do not pollute trend history.
