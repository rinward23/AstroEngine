"""Convenience exports for analysis helpers.

Historically the :mod:`astroengine.analysis` package exposed a wide selection of
utility functions by default.  Some of these helpers live in modules that pull
in optional dependencies (for example Swiss Ephemeris bindings).  Recent
refactors trimmed these re-exports which in turn caused imports from legacy
routers and tests to fail when they expected functions such as
``find_lunations`` or ``aries_ingress_year`` to be available at the package
level.  To restore that behaviour we explicitly import the public utilities
here while keeping the optional dependencies lazily evaluated inside their
respective modules.  The imports below only touch lightweight definitions so
installations without optional extras continue to work until the first call to
an optional-heavy helper.
