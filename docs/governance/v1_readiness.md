# AstroEngine v1 Readiness Assessment

- **Assessment date**: 2025-10-05
- **Assessors**: Governance Oversight (ChatGPT)

## Summary

AstroEngine has satisfied every specification acceptance checkpoint, and the final burndown items—Solar Fire provenance ingestion (Task I-9) and UX overlay documentation (Task I-13)—now have committed evidence. Dataset checksums for the Solar Fire comparison exports are captured in `qa/artifacts/solarfire/2025-10-02/provenance_ingestion.md`, and the UX module now references indexed atlas/timezone sources in `docs/module/ux/overlays_data_sources.md`. With those artefacts filed, no open scope remains for the v1 release.

## Completed gates

- All documentation sections enumerated in the acceptance checklist remain complete with evidence links, covering transit math, data packs, detectors, providers, interop, QA, release, and governance updates.
- Solar Fire export checksums and ingestion notes are recorded in `qa/artifacts/solarfire/2025-10-02/provenance_ingestion.md`, supplementing the existing acceptance checklist attachments.
- UX overlays now document atlas and timezone inputs in `docs/module/ux/overlays_data_sources.md`, closing the final documentation dependency prior to enabling runtime overlays.
- QA validation, including environment capture, pytest execution, and cross-engine comparisons, is documented in the archived artefacts at `qa/artifacts/`.

## Outstanding actions before v1

None. All burndown items are closed, evidence is archived, and the acceptance checklist has been refreshed with the latest sign-off date.

## Recommendation

Proceed with the v1 release. Coordinate with Release Operations to execute the launch checklist, tagging the release commit and distributing the artefact bundle that includes the latest ingestion and UX documentation.

## Immediate go-live blockers

No blockers remain. To preserve auditability:

1. Keep the ingestion evidence (`qa/artifacts/solarfire/2025-10-02/`) bundled with the release archive.
2. Reference `docs/module/ux/overlays_data_sources.md` in future overlay changes to ensure provenance notes stay current.
3. Notify Release Coordination that validation has concluded and schedule the launch window.
