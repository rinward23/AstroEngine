## Governance Notes

- Future updates must append new rows rather than altering completed entries to preserve history.
- Evidence links should reference immutable resources (git commit hashes, signed reports) stored alongside datasets.
- Any regression or dataset integrity alert reopens the relevant task with status `⛔ Blocked` until remediation documented.

This tracker demonstrates that every deliverable from the specification plan is documented with traceable evidence tied to real data sources.
