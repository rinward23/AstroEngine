<!-- >>> AUTO-GEN BEGIN: Time-Lords v1.0 (instructions) -->
Scope
- Zodiacal Releasing (ZR), Firdaria (day/night variants), Vimshottari (ref: VEDIC_SPEC) — as optional context timelines.

Zodiacal Releasing (Lot of Spirit default)
- Period lengths (years): Aries 15, Taurus 8, Gemini 20, Cancer 25, Leo 19, Virgo 20, Libra 8, Scorpio 15, Sagittarius 12, Capricorn 27, Aquarius 30, Pisces 12.
- Levels L1–L4: recursive subdivision by the same sign sequence; distribute proportionally by sign length.
- Inputs: lot_degree (Fortune/Spirit), zodiac = Tropical or Sidereal per profile; house system for sign lord optional.
- Outputs: spans with level, sign, lord, start/end ISO; angle hits flagged when releasing into sign containing ASC/MC/IC/DSC.

Firdaria
- Day charts start with Sun; night charts with Moon. Sequence and sub‑periods per tradition.
- Deliverable: table of spans w/ lords; profile toggles for variant tables.

Gate Usage
- Provide context flags used in scoring (e.g., +10% when transit hits current L1 lord; +5% for L2).

Acceptance
- L1 spans sum to lifetime window; nesting continuity (no gaps); published examples reproduced within 1 day.
