Properties:
- Angle normalization: wrapping to [0,360) and deltas to (-180,180].
- Δλ continuity across 359°↔1° boundaries.
- Severity monotonicity: approaches max at exact; symmetric within tolerance.
- Parallel/antiscia symmetry invariants.
- Determinism under identical seeds and inputs.

Use Hypothesis strategies for angles/times; cap test time in CI.
