# AstroEngine
A modular, research-grade transit engine with VCA scoring and cross-tradition coverage.

- Read the [Quickstart](quickstart.md) to set up Swiss Ephemeris and run
  the initial transit sanity check.
- Review the AGPL-3.0-only [licensing notice](../README.md#licensing--ephemeris-defaults)
  and decide whether to stay on the default Moshier backend or opt in to the
  Swiss download via `astroengine-ephe --agree-license`.
- Dive into the [Profiles guide](profiles.md) to understand how orbs,
  feature flags, and providers are orchestrated without losing
  provenance.
- Follow the [recipes](recipes/index.md) to reproduce a daily planner,
  electional sweep, and transit-to-progressed synastry with real data.
