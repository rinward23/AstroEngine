# >>> AUTO-GEN BEGIN: py311 compatibility doc v1.0
This project targets Python **3.11** for runtime compatibility with Swiss Ephemeris.

## Sweep script
- Safe fixes: `typing.override` â†’ `typing_extensions.override`.
- Reports PEP-695 generic syntax; manual refactor if present.

## Lockfile
- `requirements.lock/py311.txt` is generated by pip-tools in CI.

## Dependency guardrails
- `pyproject.toml` restricts `pyswisseph` wheels to Python 3.11 builds to align
  with upstream release availability.

## CI behavior
- Matrix tests pin to 3.11 across operating systems; Swiss tests run on every job.
