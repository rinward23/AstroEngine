<!-- >>> AUTO-GEN BEGIN: Synastry & Composite v1.0 (instructions) -->
Synastry:
- A→B and B→A transits with own caps and profile; combined narrative sorts by severity.
Composite:
- Midpoint-composite chart; transits to composite with tight orbs; optional Davidson later.
Acceptance:
- At least one acceptance scenario covering A↔B with symmetric outputs; composite exacts refined.
