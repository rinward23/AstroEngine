Scope
- Distinguish **Black Moon Lilith (BML)** from asteroid 1181 Lilith. Support **Mean** and **True (osculating)** BML; **Priapus** is the point opposite BML (180°).

Provider Requirements
- Expose mean/true BML longitudes for a given time; document source and method. Priapus = BML + 180° (normalized).

Aspects & Orbs
- Default: treat as personal-class for orbs (6° majors, 2° minors) with **conjunctions** prioritized (≤3° recommended). To angles/luminaries, tighten orbs by 0.5–1°.

Gating
- Include when BML/Priapus aspects natal luminaries, ASC/MC/IC/DSC, or Nodes. Partile conjunctions always pass.

Outputs
- `point_kind: BML_mean|BML_true|Priapus`, method metadata, aspect details, and notes distinguishing from asteroid 1181.

Acceptance
- Mean/True delta documented; Priapus computed exactly 180° apart; sample events generated for test windows.
