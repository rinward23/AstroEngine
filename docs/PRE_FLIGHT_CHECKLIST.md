# AstroEngine â€” Pre-Flight Checklist (v0.1)

## Environment
- [ ] Python pinned to **3.11** in CI (Actions).
- [ ] `pyswisseph==2.10.3.2` installed where Swiss is needed.
- [ ] `SE_EPHE_PATH` points to valid Swiss ephemeris folder.

## Functional smoke
- [ ] `python -c "import swisseph as swe; print(swe.__version__)"` works.
- [ ] `scripts/swe_smoketest.py` prints a Julian Day and does not error.

## Performance
- [ ] `pytest -q -m perf` passes locally.
- [ ] `python scripts/perf/bench_scan.py` completes in a reasonable time window.

## Data & Registry
- [ ] `registry/aspects.yaml` has core aspects (0/60/90/120/180).
- [ ] `registry/orbs_policy.yaml` has `orbs_default` with luminaries/personal/social/outer/minors.

## Safety nets
- [x] AUTO-GEN fence validators green. (2025-10-02T02:41Z via `python scripts/validators/validate_fences.py`)
- [x] Issue triage workflow updated meta health report. (2025-10-02T02:43Z via `GITHUB_REPOSITORY=astroengine/AstroEngine python .github/triage/scan_repo.py --update-issues --write-index docs/ISSUE_INDEX.md` with offline fallback noted)
